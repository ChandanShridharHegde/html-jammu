            <p>Before 1947, the modern state of<mark> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)">Jammu and Kashmir</a></mark>  spanned <b>86,024</b> square miles, stretching between latitudes <b>32° 78'</b> to <b>36° 58' N </b>and longitudes <b>73° 27' </b>to<b> 80° 72' E.</b> This vast region included<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu" >Jammu</a></mark>, <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladakh" > Ladakh</a></mark>,<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgit"> Gilgit</a></mark>, <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunza_Valley">Hunza</a></mark>, <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagar_Valley">Nagar</a></mark>, <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punial">Punial</a></mark>, and<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasin_Valley"> Yasin</a></mark>. <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitral">Chitral</a></mark>, a small state to the northwest of<mark> Gilgit</mark>, paid tribute to the ruler of <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley">Kashmir</a></mark>. The state's current form was largely shaped by the relentless efforts of,<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulab_Singh"> Maharaja Gulab Singh</a> </mark>, who founded the<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogra_dynasty"> Dogra Hindu dynasty </a> </mark> in Kashmir in the second half of the <b>19th century.</b> </p>
            <p class="two">Nestled in the Himalayas, Kashmir is often considered one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It is unique in India for having a recorded history of its ancient past, unlike many other regions of the country. This led the <b>11th-century</b> Islamic scholar<mark> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">  Al-Beruni </a></mark>to observe that Indians generally lacked a sense of history. However, Kashmir has produced notable historians, such as<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalhana"> Kalhana</a></mark> who wrote the<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajatarangini"> Rajatarangini</a></mark>, and <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilhana"> Bilhana</a></mark>, a <mark>Sanskrit historian</mark> born in <mark>Kashmir</mark> who later became a court poet in <b>South India</b> and authored<mark><b> Vikramankadeva-charita</b></mark> to honor the reign of the <mark>Chalukya king, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikramaditya_VI" >Vikramaditya VI</a></mark>.

             <br>   The name Kashmir is derived from <mark><b>"Ka" (water</b>)</mark> and <mark><b>"Shimeera" (to desiccate)</b></mark>, meaning <mark><b>"land desiccated from water."</b></mark> According to tradition, Kashmir was once a lake, drained by the ancient Indian sage<mark><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa"> Kashyap</a></b></mark>. The region was part of the<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire">Mauryan Empire</a> </mark> under<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka"> Emperor Ashoka</a></mark>, who is credited with founding the city of<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar" >Srinagar</a> </mark>around <b>250 BC.</b</p>
